**Understanding the drivers of healthy  life expectancy in Wales**

**Introduction**

This repository contains the source code, datasets, and analysis used in my MSc dissertation project, Understanding the Drivers of Healthy Life Expectancy in Wales. This project investigates socio-demographic, behavioural, and health-related determinants affecting self-reported health outcomes in Wales. Using data from the National Survey for Wales (NSW) conducted between 2021 and 2023, this research applies logistic regression models to identify key factors influencing health disparities.

**Features**

Analysis of over 20,000 respondents from the National Survey for Wales.
Application of logistic regression models to examine socio-demographic and health-related variables.
Investigation of health disparities across income, age, and lifestyle factors.
Visualisation of model performance using Forest Plots and ROC Curves.
Comparative analysis with similar research conducted in England.

**Usage**

This project includes various analyses aimed at understanding health disparities in Wales. Key scripts and their functionalities:
Cleaning and preprocessing the survey dataset.
Exploratory data analysis with visualizations.
Implementation of logistic regression models.
Performance evaluation using AUC-ROC and Forest Plots.

**Results & Findings**

Key health determinants: Age (65+), BMI (Obesity), Smoking, and Income significantly influence self-reported health outcomes.
Chronic health conditions: Musculoskeletal and mental health disorders are major contributors to poor health.
Policy recommendations: The results advocate for smoking cessation programs, obesity reduction strategies, and improved mental health support in deprived regions.
Model performance: The logistic regression model demonstrated strong predictive ability with well-calibrated AUC-ROC scores.
